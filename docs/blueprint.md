## Core Features:

- Admin Panel Authentication: Implement a password-protected admin panel accessible from the frontend, with session timeout and basic encryption for password storage in localStorage.
- Website Branding Customization: Enable website branding customization, including logo upload (stores as Base64), color scheme adjustments (primary, secondary, background), and font style editing, all managed through the admin panel and saved in browser storage.
- Content Management System: Develop a content management system within the admin panel for adding, editing, and deleting services (including icons and descriptions), managing news updates (scrolling ticker, announcements), and modifying the About Us section (text and images), with all changes stored in browser storage.
- Header & Footer Customization: Provide customization options for the header and footer via the admin panel, allowing users to edit navigation menu links, update contact details (phone, email, address), and manage social media links, with all updates saved locally.
- Data Backup & Restore: Implement export and import functionality within the admin panel, enabling users to download all settings as a JSON file for backup purposes and upload a JSON file to restore previous settings from browser storage.
- Frontend Structure: Design a responsive, single-page application with key sections including a header, hero section (rotating banners), services, news ticker, About Us, and footer. All editable via the admin panel, and without external dependencies.
- Offline Persistence: Use browser storage (localStorage for settings, IndexedDB for larger data) to keep settings persistent even in offline mode.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saffron (#FF9933), representing courage and sacrifice, fitting for an Indian-themed color scheme.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a desaturated variant of the primary color, provides a neutral backdrop to ensure readability.
- Accent color: Forest green (#228B22), analogous to saffron, symbolizes prosperity and auspiciousness, creating a harmonious balance.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for clarity and warmth.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif that pairs well with the body text, offering elegance to headers.
- Incorporate traditional Indian symbols and motifs in the icons to enhance the cultural relevance and aesthetic appeal.
- Maintain a clean, responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and optimal viewing across devices.
- Use subtle CSS transitions for hover effects and banner rotations to enhance user engagement without overwhelming the interface.
